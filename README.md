# PipeDrive Bundle for Symfony2/3
## PHP API client library for the PipeDrive CRM wrapped into a bundle
   
Only some basic functionality required for my current project has been added. However the basic blocks are to make use of the whole API including file uploading.

Recommend you install this library through composer. https://packagist.org/packages/benhawker/pipedrive

API Docs can be found here: https://developers.pipedrive.com/v1
